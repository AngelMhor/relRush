# Complete Unity Developer 2.0 - Section 5 - Realm Rush

This is the long-awaited sequel to the Complete Unity Developer - one of the most successful e-learning courses on the internet! Completely re-worked from scratch with brand-new projects and our latest teaching techniques. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught over 300,000 students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo.

## In This Section
This is a 3D isometric tech demo designed to teach the fundamentals of AI pathfinding, namely Breadth First Search or BFS. (Section REF: RR_CU2)

## How To Build / Compile
This is a Unity project. If you're familiar with source control, then "clone this repo". Otherwise download the contents, and navigate to `Assets > Levels` then open any `.unity` file.

This branch is the course branch, each commit corresponds to a lecture in the course. The current state is our latest progress.
